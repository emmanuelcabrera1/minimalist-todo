# HTML Apps Workspace

## Intent
This workspace is dedicated to the development and management of **HTML applications, webpages, and experiments**. It follows a Zero-Entropy philosophy to ensure organization and scalability.

## Structure Overview
The workspace is organized into semantic directories:

- **`projects/`**: proper web applications (e.g., `well-structured-todo`).
- **`documentation/`**: Meta-prompts, guides, and agent rules.
- **`templates/`**: Standardized starting points for new projects.
- **`_orphans/`**: Holding area for files pending review or deletion.
- **`config/`**: Shared design tokens and configuration.
- **`scripts/`**: Automation and utility scripts.
- **`tests/`**: Global tests and verification protocols.
- **`docs/`**: AI context files.

## Active Projects
- **[Experiments Web (Gold Standard)](projects/experiments-web/README.md)**: The reference implementation for PWA structure and documentation.
- **[Minimalist Todo](projects/minimalist-todo/README.md)**: A glassmorphism-styled todo application.
