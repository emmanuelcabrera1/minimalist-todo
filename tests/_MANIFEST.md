# Tests Directory

## Intent
Contains test files that mirror the `projects/` structure for organized testing.

## Structure
```
tests/
├── minimalist-todo/     # Tests for minimalist-todo project
├── diagnostic.test.html # General diagnostic tests
└── minimal.test.html    # Minimal functionality tests
```

## Usage
- Place project-specific tests in matching subdirectories
- Name test files with `.test.` suffix for clarity
